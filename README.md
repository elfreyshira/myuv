myuv: Quick Movie Ratings
====

## [Live App](http://elfreyshira.com/myuv)

### Background
Let's watch a movie. "War of the Worlds"? Google it. Is it good? Hmm, the second result is IMDB, it got 6.5.
Okay, I wonder what Rotten Tomatoes thinks. Where is it? Oh it's like the eighth result. It got 74%. From critics or audience?
Oh, it's from critics. Okay, umm, what about "I Am Sam". I heard it was good. Google it. Oh nice, 7.6 on IMDB, the first result.
The third result is Rotten Tomatoes, and holy crap 34%? Click to link to see what Rotten Tomatoes audience thinks. 87%! Nice.
Okay, how does this compare to "War of the Worlds"? Wait, I forgot. Crap I already closed that tab.
Screw it, I'm going to use [myuv](http://elfreyshira.com/myuv) from now on. It shows results from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes
Critics, Rotten Tomatoes Audience, The Movie Database (TMDB), Metacritic Critics, and Metacritic Users.

### First Version
I made the [first version](https://github.com/elfreyshira/myuv-old) of this app in Spring 2012. Before that, during an interview,
I got asked to manipulate JSON responses with AJAX. I had no previous knowledge of AJAX so I had to Google on the spot. After the
interview, I wanted to learn more about asynchronous api's and started messing around with it. I built myuv to learn more and to
solve a problem. It was built with jQuery.

### Second Version
I started learning AngularJS, NodeJS, GruntJS, Browserify, and other cool things about writing less-horrible code. Two years
later, in the Spring/Summer of 2014, I decided to re-write myuv with AngularJS to get better at it. No jQuery. This version also
added two ratings results from Metacritic. Oh, and it's mobile-friendly. To get fancy, you can open it in Safari and add it to
your homepage like and it'll open like a standalone app.
